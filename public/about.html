<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm a second-year undergraduate student in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering (ENTC), but my interest in computers has led me to dive into the IT field as well. Even though my primary focus is ENTC, I'm constantly working on building skills in software development and exploring different areas of IT. By combining my background in electronics with my passion for computing, I'm aiming to develop a strong, versatile skill set that will open up unique opportunities in tech.</p>
